## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Dylan, and I am a senior majoring in CS at Old Dominion University. 
###
I have experience working with the following languages: 
<ul>
  <li>Java</li>
  <li>C++</li>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>JavaScript</li>
  <li>SQL</li>
</ul>

I like coding in Java the most out of the languages I am familiar with. I am also currently learning Rust as a side-endeavor but have not done any significant projects with it.
